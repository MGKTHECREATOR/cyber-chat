Here’s your polished **README.md**:

💡 Why I Built This

I wanted to create a chat app that isn’t just functional but also feels **modern and enjoyable to use**.
Most tutorials end up with very plain designs, so I added a **cyber-green theme, smooth UI, and theme toggle** to make it unique.

This project is also a great starting point for anyone learning how to build **real-time apps** with a **beautiful front-end experience**.
